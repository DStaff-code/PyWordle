1. Game is fully functioning as expected. Please double check and review to ensure the program handles any 
and all bad input that could come from the user. 

2. The terminal is difficult to read. Consider adding spacing, characters, ASCII art to help make the terminal more 
readable and even fun for the user

3. Consider adding a feature that shows the user the letters they have already guessed. This isn’t in the original 
worlde game, but may be a nice feature to add.  --- ASCII Art to cover

4. You’ve used some comments, but I recommend cleaning them up and using them throughout your code.
